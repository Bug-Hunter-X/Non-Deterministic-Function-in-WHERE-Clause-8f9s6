To fix the issue, the non-deterministic function should be removed from the WHERE clause or replaced with a deterministic alternative.  The specific solution depends on the intended purpose.  If randomness is not actually needed, the function can be removed entirely.  If a specific, repeatable random selection is desired, more sophisticated techniques like creating a temporary table with a random order and then selecting from that can be used.

For instance, to select a random subset of rows from the `employees` table (using MySQL's `ORDER BY RAND()` which is itself not efficient for large datasets):

```sql
-- Using a subquery with LIMIT for efficiency
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10) as tempTable;
-- Or a more efficient way (not all databases support this)
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10;
```

Alternatively, if the goal was to select half of the employees, we would need to specify a condition that is deterministic:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id % 2 = 0; -- Selects even-numbered employees
```
This approach guarantees consistent results for the same data.
