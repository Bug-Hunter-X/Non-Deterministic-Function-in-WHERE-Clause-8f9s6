The SQL query uses a function within a WHERE clause that is not deterministic. This can lead to unpredictable results, especially when the query is optimized by the database engine.  Consider this example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE RAND() < 0.5;
```

The `RAND()` function generates a random number between 0 and 1.  The result of this query will differ on each execution, even if the `employees` table hasn't changed. This makes debugging and testing difficult.
